<p align="center">Demo project for my tutorial about creating a Zombie AI that roams, chases the player, attacks the player, and dies when shot.<p>

This is the demo project for the tutorial at [Unreal C++ Creating a Zombie AI](https://robertcorponoi.com/unreal-c-creating-a-zombie-ai/) which explains how to set up a an AI that roams, chases the player, attacks the player, and dies when shot.

This demo was created with Unreal 4.25.3

## Instructions

- Clone or download the repo, open it in Unreal, and press play.

- The ZombieCharacter will roam around the level and chase you if you get into its line of sight.

- If you let the ZombieCharacter get close to you it'll start attacking you. If you leave its line of sight then it will stare at you for a bit and then go back to roaming.

- You can shoot the ZombieCharacter to have it die and be destroyed.

There are many variables within the PlayerCharacter and ZombieCharacter that can be edited to adjust the AI logic and gameplay.
